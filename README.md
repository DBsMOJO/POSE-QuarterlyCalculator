# POSE-QuarterlyCalculator

## Specification

This program is intended to determine the quarter in which the user's birth
month occurs. So the user enters their birth month in the form of number
between 1 and 12. The program then outputs the corresponding quarter.

In addition, the program should also check whether the user has entered a valid
number. If not, an error message should be output.
